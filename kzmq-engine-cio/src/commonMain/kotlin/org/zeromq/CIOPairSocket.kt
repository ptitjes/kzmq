/**
 * An implementation of the [PAIR socket](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec/31/).
 *
 * ## The Exclusive Pair Pattern
 *
 * The implementation SHOULD follow [http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:31/EXPAIR] for the semantics of
 * exclusive PAIR sockets.
 *
 * ## Overall Goals of this Pattern
 *
 * PAIR is not a general-purpose socket but is intended for specific use cases where the two peers
 * are architecturally stable. This usually limits PAIR to use within a single process, for
 * inter-thread communication.
 *
 * ## The PUSH Socket Type
 *
 * A. General behavior:
 * 1. MAY be connected to at most one PAIR peers, and MAY both send and receive messages.
 * 2. SHALL not filter or modify outgoing or incoming messages in any way.
 * 3. SHALL maintain a double queue for its peer, allowing outgoing and incoming messages to be
 *    queued independently.
 * 4. SHALL create a double queue when initiating an outgoing connection to a peer, and SHALL
 *    maintain the double queue whether or not the connection is established.
 * 5. SHALL create a double queue when a peer connects to it. If this peer disconnects, the PAIR
 *    socket SHALL destroy its double queue and SHALL discard any messages it contains.
 * 6. SHOULD constrain incoming and outgoing queue sizes to a runtime-configurable limit.
 *
 * B. For processing outgoing messages:
 * 1. SHALL consider its peer as available only when it has a outgoing queue that is not full.
 * 2. SHALL block on sending, or return a suitable error, when it has no available peer.
 * 3. SHALL not accept further messages when it has no available peer.
 * 4. SHALL NOT discard messages that it cannot queue.
 *
 * C. For processing incoming messages:
 * 1. SHALL receive incoming messages from its single peer if it has one.
 * 2. SHALL deliver these to its calling application.
