/**
 * An implementation of the [REP socket](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec/28/).
 *
 * ## The Request-Reply Pattern
 *
 * The implementation SHOULD follow [http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:28/REQREP] for the semantics of
 * REQ, REP, DEALER and ROUTER sockets.
 *
 * ## Overall Goals of this Pattern
 *
 * The request-reply pattern is intended for service-oriented architectures of various kinds. It
 * comes in two basic flavors: synchronous (REQ and REP), and asynchronous (DEALER and ROUTER),
 * which may be mixed in various ways. The DEALER and ROUTER sockets are building blocks for many
 * higher-level protocols such as [rfc.zeromq.org/spec:18/MDP].
 *
 * ## The REP Socket Type
 *
 * The REP socket type acts as as service for a set of client peers, receiving requests and sending
 * replies back to the requesting peers. It is designed for simple remote-procedure call models.
 *
 * A. General behavior:
 * 1. MAY be connected to any number of REQ or DEALER peers.
 * 2. SHALL not filter or modify outgoing or incoming messages in any way.
 * 3. SHALL receive and then send exactly one message at a time.
 *
 * B. The request and reply messages SHALL have this format on the wire:
 * 1. An address envelope consisting of zero or more frames, each containing one identity.
 * 2. A delimiter, consisting of an empty frame.
 * 3. One or more data frames, comprising the message visible to the application.
 *
 * C. For processing incoming messages:
 * 1. SHALL receive incoming messages from its peers using a fair-queuing strategy.
 * 2. SHALL remove and store the address envelope, including the delimiter.
 * 3. SHALL pass the remaining data frames to its calling application.
 *
 * D. For processing outgoing messages:
 * 1. SHALL wait for a single reply message from its calling application.
 * 2. SHALL prepend the address envelope and delimiter.
 * 3. SHALL deliver this message back to the originating peer.
 * 4. SHALL silently discard the reply, or return an error, if the originating peer is no longer
 *    connected.
 * 5. SHALL not block on sending.
