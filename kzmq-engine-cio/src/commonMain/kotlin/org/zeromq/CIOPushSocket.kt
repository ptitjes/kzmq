/**
 * An implementation of the [PUSH socket](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec/30/).
 *
 * ## The Pipeline Pattern
 *
 * The implementation SHOULD follow [http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:30/PIPELINE] for the semantics of
 * PUSH and PULL sockets.
 *
 * ## Overall Goals of this Pattern
 *
 * The pattern is intended for task distribution, typically in a multi-stage pipeline where one or
 * a few nodes push work to many workers, and they in turn push results to one or a few collectors.
 * The pattern is mostly reliable insofar as it will not discard messages unless a node disconnects
 * unexpectedly. It is scalable in that nodes can join at any time.
 *
 * ## The PUSH Socket Type
 *
 * The PUSH socket type talks to a set of anonymous PULL peers, sending messages using a
 * round-robin algorithm.
 *
 * A. General behavior:
 * 1. MAY be connected to any number of PULL peers, and SHALL only send messages.
 * 2. SHALL not filter or modify outgoing messages in any way.
 * 3. SHALL maintain an outgoing message queue for each connected peer.
 * 4. SHALL create this queue when initiating an outgoing connection to a peer, and SHALL maintain
 *    the queue whether or not the connection is established.
 * 5. SHALL create this queue when a peer connects to it. If this peer disconnects, the PUSH socket
 *    SHALL destroy its queue and SHALL discard any messages it contains.
 * 6. SHOULD constrain queue sizes to a runtime-configurable limit.
 *
 * B. For processing outgoing messages:
 * 1. SHALL consider a peer as available only when it has a outgoing queue that is not full.
 * 2. SHALL route outgoing messages to available peers using a round-robin strategy.
 * 3. SHALL block on sending, or return a suitable error, when it has no available peers.
 * 4. SHALL not accept further messages when it has no available peers.
 * 5. SHALL NOT discard messages that it cannot queue.
