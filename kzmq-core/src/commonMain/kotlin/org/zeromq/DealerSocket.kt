/**
 * A ZeroMQ socket of type [DEALER][Type.DEALER].
 * Peers must be [ReplySocket]s or [RouterSocket]s.
 *
 * A [DealerSocket] does load-balancing on outputs and fair-queuing on inputs with no other semantics.
 * It is the only socket type that lets you shuffle messages out to N nodes and shuffle the replies back,
 * in a raw bidirectional asynchronous pattern.
 *
 * A [DealerSocket] is an advanced pattern used for extending request/reply sockets.
 *
 * Each message sent is distributed in a round-robin fashion among all connected peers,
 * and each message received is fair-queued from all connected peers.
 *
 * When a [DealerSocket] enters the mute state due to having reached the high watermark for all peers,
 * or if there are no peers at all, then any [send()][SendSocket.send] operations on the socket shall suspend
 * until the mute state ends or at least one peer becomes available for sending; messages are not discarded.
 *
 * When a [DealerSocket] is connected to a [ReplySocket] each message sent must consist of
 * an empty message frame, the delimiter, followed by one or more body parts.
